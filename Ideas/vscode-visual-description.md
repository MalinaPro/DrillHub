## Fonts

VS Code uses a default font stack that depends on the operating system.

| Operating System | Font Stack |

| Windows | Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace |
| macOS | Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace |
| Linux | 'Droid Sans Mono', 'Inconsolata', 'Courier New', monospace |

## Animations & Transitions

VS Code uses subtle animations and transitions to provide a smooth user experience. These are primarily defined using CSS transitions. Some examples include:

*   **Hover effects:** Buttons, tabs, and other UI elements have hover effects that change their background color or border.
*   **Smooth scrolling:** The editor scrolls smoothly, rather than instantly jumping to the new position.
*   **View transitions:** When opening and closing views, such as the sidebar or panel, they slide in and out smoothly.

## Structure

The VS Code UI is divided into several key areas:

*   **Activity Bar:** Located on the far left, it allows you to switch between views (e.g., Explorer, Search, Source Control).
*   **Side Bar:** Contains different views, such as the Explorer, which shows the files in your project.
*   **Editor Group:** The main area where you edit your files. You can have multiple editor groups open at once.
*   **Panel:** Appears below the editor group and contains views like the Terminal, Output, and Debug Console.
*   **Status Bar:** Located at the bottom of the window, it displays information about the current project and file.

## Buttons

Buttons in VS Code have a consistent style. They are typically rectangular with a solid background color and a subtle border. When you hover over a button, its background color changes to indicate that it's interactive.
